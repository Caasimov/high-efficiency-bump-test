# High-Efficiency Bump Test

This repository is dedicated to testing and validating a new method of reversal bump identification and classification in Stewart-Gough platforms. The new test method aims to reduce platform travel time in zones that do not generate reversal bumps, which typically occur at velocity sign reversals.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or above installed on your system. You can check your Python version using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
```

```bash
git clone --branch WIP https://github.com/Caasimov/high-efficiency-bump-test
```

After cloning, navigate to the cloned repository directory: cd

```bash
cd high-efficiency-bump-test
```

Then, run the setup script:

```bash
python3 setup.py
