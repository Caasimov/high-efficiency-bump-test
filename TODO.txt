1. FFT -> isolate reversal bump harmonics -> sum X_i's & get magnitude -> get reference amplitude -> match per wavelength & plot in bump amplitude vs input amplitude plot

2. Implement de Bode diagram with revised wavelength function:
    a) Should have fewer issues with finding a suitable wavelength so try direct lift from main branch.
    b) If that fails, rewrite &/ troubleshoot with Ren√©.

3. Get R^2 for all trendlines.
