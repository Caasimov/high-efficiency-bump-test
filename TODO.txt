1. Multi-sine:
    a) Check whether the zero-crossing method can be made to work (extend interval to include whole thing maybe??)
    b) Fourier analysis for de Bode plots.

2. Investigate growing frequency/phase disparity at high f_0 for AGARD files.

3. Implement de Bode diagram with revised wavelength function:
    a) Should have fewer issues with finding a suitable wavelength so try direct lift from main branch.
    b) If that fails, rewrite &/ troubleshoot with RenÃ©.

4. Investigate a method for saving fragment locations to reduce runtime.

5. Plotting:
    a) Add new directories to project_dir.py for various plots.
    b) Add either universal plot function or brute-force (lazy).
    c) Agree on std format for plots -> churn out results.

6. Trendline for z-pos, z-neg and x for AGARD test to determine where the slope differences come from &/ effect of gravity

7. Get R^2 for all trendlines.
