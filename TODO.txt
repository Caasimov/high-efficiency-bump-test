1. Exclude motionless sections:
    a) Either issue in JSON processing signalling valid sections when it shouldn't.
    b) OR issue with wavelength/zero_crossings function in functions.py:
        i. If so, try adding a check in either function for somewhere in the middle of the interval if i and i+1 == 0.

2. Ensure bump files can be accurately read and analyzed given current implementation of bump_analysis in main.py.

3. Switch to pure Fourier analysis for multi-sine files.

4. Investigate growing frequency/phase disparity at high f_0 for AGARD files.

5. Implement de Bode diagram with revised wavelength function:
    a) Should have fewer issues with finding a suitable wavelength so try direct lift from main branch.
    b) If that fails, rewrite &/ troubleshoot with RenÃ©.

6. Investigate a method for saving fragment locations to reduce runtime.

7. Plotting:
    a) Add new directories to project_dir.py for various plots.
    b) Add either universal plot function or brute-force (lazy).
    c) Agree on std format for plots -> churn out results.
